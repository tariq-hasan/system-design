# 📚 Resources: SOLID Principles

This document contains a curated list of **articles**, **books**, **videos**, and **tools** to help you dive deeper into the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

---

## 🧭 Overview

> The SOLID principles are five design guidelines intended to make software more maintainable, flexible, and scalable:
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
