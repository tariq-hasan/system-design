# NoSQL

NoSQL is somewhat a misnomer - many of these databases do use SQL-like interfaces. Key characteristics include:

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Designed to scale out across many servers
- **Schema Flexibility**: Often support schema-less or flexible schema designs
- **Key-Value Orientation**: Optimized for simple key-value lookups
