# API Design Best Practices

## Introduction to API Design

### What is an API?
- After capturing functional requirements, our system can be viewed as a black box with:
  - Defined behavior
  - Well-defined interface
- This interface serves as a contract between:
  - Engineers implementing the system
  - Client applications using the system
- As this interface is called by other applications, it's known as an Application Programming Interface (API)
- In large-scale systems, APIs are called remotely through the network
- Applications calling our API may include:
  - Frontend clients (mobile applications, web browsers)
  - Backend systems from other companies
  - Internal systems within our organization
- Each system component has its own API called by other applications within the system

## API Categories

APIs fall into three classifications:

### 1. Public APIs
- Exposed to the general public
- Any developer can use or call them from their application
- Best practice: Require user registration before allowing system use
- Benefits of registration:
  - Control over external users
  - Control over system usage
  - Enhanced security
  - Ability to blacklist rule-breakers

### 2. Private/Internal APIs
- Exposed only internally within the company
- Allow other teams/departments to:
  - Leverage the system
  - Provide greater value for the company
  - Avoid direct external system exposure

### 3. Partner APIs
- Similar to public APIs but restricted
- Exposed only to companies or users with business relationships
- Business relationships may be in the form of:
  - Customer agreements after product purchase
  - Service subscriptions

## Benefits of a Well-Designed API
- Clients can immediately enhance their business using our system
- No knowledge of internal design or implementation is required
- Integration can begin as soon as API is defined, before full system implementation
- Simplifies system architecture by defining clear endpoints and user routes

## API Best Practices and Patterns

### Complete Encapsulation
- Fully encapsulate internal design and implementation
- Abstract details away from developers using the system
- Avoid requiring knowledge of business logic or implementation details
- Maintain complete decoupling from internal design
- Enable changing design later without breaking client contracts

### Easy to Use
- Should be easy to use and understand
- Should be impossible to misuse

**Simplification strategies:**
1. Provide only one way to get specific data or perform a task
2. Use descriptive names for actions and resources
3. Expose only necessary information and actions
4. Maintain consistency throughout the API

### Keeping Operations Idempotent
- An operation that produces the same result regardless of how many times it's performed
  - **Example:** Updating a user's address (result is the same regardless of repetition)
  - **Non-example:** Incrementing a user's balance by $100 (result changes with each operation)
- Preferred for network-based APIs due to potential message loss
- When network issues occur, client applications can safely resend requests without unintended consequences

### API Pagination
- Essential when responses contain large payloads or datasets
- Without pagination, client applications struggle with large responses, degrading user experience

**Problems with unpaginated responses:**
1. Overwhelming data (like showing all emails ever received)
2. Unmanageable search results

**Benefits:**
- Allows clients to request manageable data segments
- Enables specification of maximum response size
- Provides offset capability within the overall dataset

### Asynchronous Operations
- Some operations require one comprehensive result at completion
- Useful when nothing meaningful can be provided before the operation finishes

**Use cases:**
1. Complex reports requiring multiple database connections
2. Big data analysis scanning numerous records/logs
3. Large file compression

**Implementation:**
- Client receives immediate response without waiting for final result
- Response includes an identifier for tracking progress
- Final result can be retrieved later

### Versioning APIs
- Ideal API design allows internal changes without API modifications
- In practice, non-backward compatible changes may be necessary

**Versioning strategy:**
1. Explicitly version APIs
2. Maintain multiple versions simultaneously
3. Deprecate older versions gradually
