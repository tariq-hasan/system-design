# Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the operational characteristics and quality attributes of a URL shortening service. While functional requirements specify what the system should do, non-functional requirements determine how well the system performs its functions. These requirements are critical for delivering a reliable, high-performance service that can scale to meet global demands while maintaining security and cost efficiency.

## Performance

Performance requirements establish the speed, responsiveness, and throughput expectations for the system. For URL shortening services, performance is particularly critical as users expect near-instantaneous responses, especially during the redirection process.

### URL Shortening Response Time

The URL shortening operation must be optimized for rapid completion:

- **Latency Target**: 95th percentile (p95) response time for URL shortening requests must be less than 100ms from request receipt to response delivery.

- **Regional Considerations**: Performance targets should be maintained across all geographic regions where the service is offered, with appropriate infrastructure distribution to minimize network latency.

- **Degradation Parameters**: Under heavy load conditions, graceful performance degradation is acceptable but should not exceed 200ms at p95 even at 2x peak projected load.

- **Processing Optimization**: Backend processing for URL generation, validation, and storage must be optimized to consume minimal CPU cycles, with database operations tuned for write efficiency.

- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching for frequently checked operations such as custom alias availability and domain validation to reduce repeated processing.

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-critical aspects of URL shortening (such as analytics initialization, secondary indexing, or notification delivery) should be handled asynchronously to maintain core performance.

- **Performance Budget**: Establish clear component-level performance budgets, allocating specific maximum processing time for each step in the shortening workflow.

### Redirection Latency

The redirection operation represents the most performance-critical aspect of the service:

- **P95 Latency Requirement**: 95% of all redirection requests must be processed within 50ms from request receipt to HTTP redirect response.

- **P99 Latency Requirement**: 99% of all redirection requests must be processed within 100ms, accounting for occasional cache misses or database lookups.

- **Global Performance Consistency**: Redirection latency requirements must be maintained across all geographic regions, necessitating distributed infrastructure and locality-optimized data access.
