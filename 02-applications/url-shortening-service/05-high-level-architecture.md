# High-Level Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture for a scalable, reliable URL shortening service. The architecture is designed to handle billions of shortened URLs and millions of daily redirects while maintaining high performance, availability, and security.

## System Overview

The URL shortening service architecture follows a modern, distributed systems approach with multiple specialized layers and components. The design emphasizes separation of concerns, scalability, and resilience while optimizing for the read-heavy workload characteristic of URL shortening services.

The architecture accommodates both public-facing functions (URL shortening and redirection) and internal operational capabilities (analytics, administration, and maintenance). By distributing functionality across specialized components, the system can scale each aspect independently based on demand while maintaining overall system cohesion.

## Core Components

### External Facing Layer

The External Facing Layer serves as the system's entry point, handling all incoming traffic and providing the first line of defense against attacks while optimizing global performance.

#### CDN/Edge Network

The Content Delivery Network (CDN) and edge computing infrastructure provide global distribution of the service with minimal latency:

- **Global Point of Presence (PoP)**: Deploy edge nodes across strategic global locations to minimize network latency for users worldwide, with particular density in high-traffic regions.

- **Edge Caching**: Cache frequently accessed shortened URLs at edge locations, reducing backend load for popular links and dramatically improving response times.

## Key Data Flows

Understanding the primary data flows through the system helps illustrate how components interact to fulfill the core service functions.

### Shortening Flow

The URL shortening flow creates new shortened URLs through these steps:

#### Request Reception

The process begins when a shortening request arrives through the external facing layer:

- Incoming requests are received via the API Gateway or web application frontends.
- Initial validation confirms the request contains required parameters and authentication if required.
- Request is routed to an instance of the URL Service.

#### URL Validation

Before creating a shortened URL, the system validates the destination URL:

- The URL Service checks the destination URL for valid format and structure.
- For enhanced security, an optional validation may verify the URL is reachable and returns an expected status code.
- The system may check the destination against blacklists or reputation databases to prevent abuse.
- Any custom alias requested undergoes validation for availability and policy compliance.

#### ID Generation

A unique short identifier is created through one of several algorithms:

- For system-generated IDs, the service creates a unique identifier using configured algorithms (counter-based, hash-based, or randomized).
- For custom aliases, the system verifies uniqueness and reserves the requested identifier.
- The generated ID undergoes collision detection to ensure uniqueness in the namespace.
- The system may apply additional rules such as profanity filtering or reserved keyword protection.

#### Database Storage

The new URL mapping is persisted to the database:

- The URL Service writes the mapping between short ID and destination URL to the URL Database.
- Associated metadata including creation time, owner, expiration settings, and custom parameters are stored.
- For consistency, the write operation typically requires confirmation from multiple database nodes.
- The system may update secondary indexes for owner-based or attribute-based lookups.

#### Response Generation

The system completes the operation by returning the shortened URL:

- The fully qualified shortened URL is constructed by combining the service domain with the short ID.
- Additional information such as expiration date, QR code link, or analytics baseline may be included in the response.
- The new URL may be added to relevant caches to optimize future redirects.
- The response is returned to the client through the API Gateway or web interface.

### Redirection Flow

The redirection flow handles user requests to shortened URLs, directing them to the original destinations:

#### Request Interception

The process begins when a user accesses a shortened URL:

- The request arrives at the CDN/Edge Network layer.
- Basic validation confirms the request format is valid.
- For popular URLs, the edge cache may immediately return the destination without contacting backend services.
- Non-cached requests are routed to the Redirection Service.

#### Cache Lookup

For optimal performance, the system first checks high-speed caches:

- The Redirection Service queries the Cache Layer to find the destination URL for the requested short ID.
- If found in cache, the destination URL and associated metadata are retrieved without database access.
- Cache hits represent the optimal performance path, typically completing in under 10ms.
- Cache presence is often determined by URL popularity following a power-law distribution.

#### Database Lookup

If not found in cache, the system queries the persistent database:

- The Redirection Service queries the URL Database using the short ID as the primary key.
- The query returns the destination URL along with metadata such as expiration status, access controls, and tracking parameters.
- After retrieval, the URL may be added to the cache to speed up future requests.
- If the URL is not found, the system prepares an appropriate "not found" response.

#### Analytics Recording

Click tracking occurs asynchronously to minimize latency:

- The Redirection Service asynchronously publishes a click event to the Analytics Service.
- Event data includes timestamp, short ID, user agent, IP address (potentially anonymized), and referrer information.
- This operation uses fire-and-forget patterns to prevent analytics processing from impacting redirection performance.
- Additional click metadata may be captured for enhanced analytics without blocking the redirection flow.

#### HTTP Redirect

The final step returns an HTTP redirect to the client:

- The Redirection Service determines the appropriate HTTP status code (301, 302, or 307) based on URL configuration.
- If configured, UTM parameters or other tracking codes are appended to the destination URL.
- The system generates appropriate HTTP headers including the Location header with the destination URL.
- The response is returned to the client, which will automatically request the destination URL.

### Analytics Flow

The analytics flow processes and presents interaction data for business intelligence:

#### Event Capture

The process begins with the capture of user interaction events:

- Click events are initially generated by the Redirection Service during URL access.
- Events are published to a high-throughput message queue or streaming platform.
- Initial event data includes timestamp, URL identifier, and basic request information.
- The system design prioritizes event capture reliability to prevent data loss.

#### Real-time Processing

Some analytics are processed immediately for real-time visibility:

- The Analytics Processor consumes events from the message queue in real-time.
- Events undergo enrichment with additional context such as geographic data, device information, and referrer categorization.
- The processor updates real-time counters and metrics visible in dashboards.
- Pattern detection algorithms identify unusual activity that may require attention.
- Processed events are forwarded to persistent storage while derived metrics update in-memory and cached values.

#### Storage Operations

Events and derived metrics are persisted for historical analysis:

- Enriched events are written to the Analytics Database optimized for time-series data.
- The storage layer applies appropriate partitioning, typically time-based, to maintain query performance.
- Compression algorithms minimize storage requirements for high-volume data.
- Initial aggregates may be computed and stored during the insertion process for improved query performance.
- The system maintains different retention policies for raw events versus aggregated metrics.

#### Aggregation Processing

Background processes create pre-computed views for efficient analysis:

- Scheduled batch processes aggregate data across various dimensions and time periods.
- Common aggregations include hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly rollups by URL, owner, campaign, or geographic region.
- Aggregation results are stored in optimized structures for rapid dashboard rendering.
- The system maintains aggregation pipelines for both recent and historical data with different processing priorities.
- Statistical analysis may identify trends, patterns, and anomalies across the dataset.

#### Dashboard Presentation

Analytics are exposed to users through interactive interfaces:

- Web interfaces and API endpoints retrieve pre-aggregated data from the Analytics Service.
- Visualization components render charts, graphs, and tables based on user-selected parameters.
- Real-time data combines with historical trends to provide comprehensive performance views.
- Export functions allow extraction of data for further analysis in external tools.
- Access controls ensure users see only analytics for URLs within their permission scope.

## Design Principles

The architecture is guided by several key design principles that inform component design and interaction patterns.

### Read-Optimized Architecture

The system prioritizes read performance given the heavily read-biased workload:

- **Read-Write Ratio Optimization**: Design decisions prioritize read performance (redirect operations) even when this creates additional complexity for less frequent write operations (URL creation).

- **Cache-Centric Design**: Implement multiple caching layers with high hit rates as a central architectural element rather than as a performance add-on.

- **Read Replica Deployment**: Utilize read replicas extensively across database systems to distribute query load away from primary instances.

- **Denormalization When Beneficial**: Accept appropriate data denormalization to reduce join operations and simplify read paths at the cost of more complex write operations.

- **Asynchronous Write Operations**: Move non-critical write operations (especially analytics data) out of the main request path through asynchronous processing.

- **Edge Optimization**: Push data and processing to edge locations whenever possible to minimize latency for read operations.

- **Read Path Simplification**: Continuously optimize the code path for read operations, minimizing unnecessary processing, validation, or transformation steps.

### Horizontal Scalability at All Layers

The architecture enables independent scaling of all components:

- **Stateless Application Design**: Design all application components to be stateless wherever possible, enabling simple horizontal scaling by adding identical instances.

- **Workload-Based Scaling**: Scale each component independently based on its specific resource constraints rather than scaling the entire system uniformly.

- **Distributed Data Systems**: Select database technologies and configurations that support horizontal scaling through sharding or other distribution mechanisms.

- **Connection Management**: Implement robust connection pooling and management to prevent connection limitations from becoming scaling bottlenecks.

- **Shared-Nothing Architecture**: Minimize dependencies between components, allowing independent deployment, scaling, and failover of each service.

- **Auto-Scaling Policies**: Implement automated scaling based on load metrics, with appropriate scaling policies for different components based on their scaling characteristics.

- **Scale Testing**: Regularly test scaling behavior to verify linear resource requirements and identify emerging bottlenecks before they impact production.

### Eventual Consistency for Analytics

Analytics data accepts eventual consistency to gain performance and scalability:

- **Asynchronous Event Processing**: Decouple analytics data capture from the critical request path, accepting that metrics may reflect a slightly delayed view of system activity.

- **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**: Implement appropriate conflict resolution for analytics data when multiple writes occur concurrently, typically using last-writer-wins or merge-based approaches.

- **Reconciliation Processes**: Run background reconciliation to ensure analytics data eventually achieves consistency even after network partitions or component failures.

- **Approximate Counting**: Utilize probabilistic data structures for high-volume counters where absolute precision is less important than performance and scalability.

- **Consistency Boundaries**: Clearly define consistency expectations for different types of analytics data, with timeliness guarantees appropriate to the data's use case.

- **Idempotent Processing**: Design analytics processing to be idempotent, ensuring that duplicate events do not affect accuracy of aggregate metrics.

- **Timing Tolerance**: Design dashboards and reports to accommodate the eventually consistent nature of analytics data, avoiding designs that require perfect real-time accuracy.

### Strong Consistency for URL Mappings

Core URL mapping data requires strong consistency guarantees:

- **Synchronous Write Confirmation**: Ensure URL creation and update operations receive confirmation of successful persistence before responding to clients.

- **Consistent Read Operations**: Provide read-after-write consistency for URL operations, ensuring users immediately see their own changes.

- **Transaction Support**: Utilize transaction capabilities for operations that must be atomic, such as creating a custom alias that must be unique.

- **Quorum-Based Operations**: For distributed database systems, require appropriate quorum levels for write operations to ensure consistency across replicas.

- **Conflict Prevention**: Design operations to prevent conflicts rather than resolve them after occurrence, particularly for URL namespace management.

- **Validation Workflows**: Implement rigorous validation during write operations to prevent inconsistent states from entering the database.

- **Consistency Verification**: Run periodic consistency checking processes to identify and repair any inconsistencies that might occur due to system failures.

### Failover by Design

The system assumes component failures will occur and designs for resilience:

- **No Single Points of Failure**: Eliminate single points of failure through redundancy at all layers including application, database, and networking.

- **Graceful Degradation**: Design components to continue providing core functionality even when dependent services are unavailable or degraded.

- **Automated Recovery**: Implement self-healing mechanisms that can detect and recover from common failure scenarios without human intervention.

- **Bulkhead Patterns**: Isolate components through bulkhead patterns to contain failures and prevent cascading effects throughout the system.

- **Circuit Breaker Implementation**: Use circuit breaker patterns around dependencies to fail fast when downstream services experience issues.

- **Regional Independence**: Design multi-region deployments to operate independently if inter-region communication is disrupted.

- **Regular Failover Testing**: Conduct chaos engineering exercises to verify failover mechanisms work as expected under various failure conditions.

This high-level architecture provides a comprehensive framework for implementing a URL shortening service that can scale to billions of URLs while maintaining high performance, reliability, and security. The separation of concerns across specialized components allows the system to evolve and scale individual aspects as needed while the key data flows demonstrate how these components work together to deliver the core service functionality.
