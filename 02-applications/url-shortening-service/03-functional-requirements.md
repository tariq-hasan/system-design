# Functional Requirements

This document details the comprehensive functional requirements for a robust URL shortening service. These requirements define the core capabilities, user interactions, and advanced features necessary to deliver a complete solution that meets diverse use cases.

## URL Operations

The foundation of any URL shortening service lies in its core URL operations. These essential functions define how the system processes, transforms, and manages links throughout their lifecycle.

### URL Shortening

The primary function of converting long URLs into compact, manageable aliases must meet several technical requirements:

- **Transformation Algorithm**: Implement a consistent, reliable algorithm to generate shortened URLs from original links, ensuring uniqueness across billions of potential URLs.

- **Character Set Definition**: Utilize a clearly defined character set (typically base62: a-z, A-Z, 0-9) that balances brevity with readability while avoiding potentially confusing character combinations.

- **Length Optimization**: Generate aliases of minimal length (typically 6-8 characters) while maintaining sufficient namespace to accommodate projected growth.

- **Processing Performance**: Complete URL shortening operations within defined performance thresholds (typically <200ms) even under peak load conditions.

- **Input Validation**: Thoroughly validate input URLs for proper formatting, protocol support (HTTP/HTTPS), domain validity, and potential security issues before processing.

- **Metadata Capture**: Record essential metadata during the shortening process, including creation timestamp, original URL, creator information (if authenticated), and initial settings.

- **Duplicate Handling**: Implement configurable behavior for handling duplicate URL submissions, either creating new aliases each time or returning existing aliases for identical URLs.

- **URL Normalization**: Standardize URL formats by handling variations in protocols, trailing slashes, default ports, and capitalization to avoid unnecessary duplication.

### URL Redirection

The redirection mechanism must efficiently and reliably direct users from shortened URLs to their original destinations:

- **Lookup Efficiency**: Implement high-performance lookup systems capable of resolving shortened URLs to their destinations in <50ms at p95 percentile.

- **HTTP Redirection Method**: Utilize appropriate HTTP redirect methods (301 Permanent, 302 Temporary, or 307 Temporary Preserve Method) based on use case and configuration.

- **Error Handling**: Provide graceful handling of invalid, expired, or deactivated URLs with appropriate user feedback and status codes.

- **Redirect Chains**: Minimize redirect chains by sending users directly to final destinations rather than through intermediate redirects that impact performance.

- **Preservation of Parameters**: Maintain any additional query parameters appended to the shortened URL by adding them to the destination URL during redirection.

- **Redirect Logging**: Capture essential information about each redirect event for analytics while respecting privacy considerations and applicable regulations.

- **Bot Handling**: Implement specific logic for handling automated traffic from web crawlers, monitoring systems, and other non-human agents.

- **Rate Limiting**: Apply appropriate rate limits to prevent abuse while ensuring legitimate high-volume use cases remain functional.

### Custom Aliases

Providing user-defined short URLs requires additional functionality beyond basic shortening:
