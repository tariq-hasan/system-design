# 2. Use Cases

Object storage is a versatile solution with applications across many domains. The following use cases highlight common implementation patterns, technical advantages, and real-world examples that demonstrate the value of blob stores in modern system architecture.

## Media Content Delivery
Store and serve user-generated content such as images, audio, and video. Ideal for streaming services or social platforms that handle large volumes of media files.

*Example*: Netflix uses blob storage to store thousands of video assets, serving millions of concurrent users accessing hundreds of petabytes of content daily across 190+ countries.

*Technical advantages*:
- Content can be easily distributed via CDNs with origin in blob storage, providing global reach with minimal infrastructure
- Support for byte range requests enables video streaming with seeking capabilities
- Automatic transcoding workflows can be triggered by upload events
- Metadata tagging allows efficient content organization and searching

*Design considerations*:
- Implement caching strategies to reduce origin requests for popular content
- Use pre-signed URLs with expiration for secure, temporary access
- Consider region-specific storage to reduce latency for global audiences

## Data Backup & Archiving
Support long-term storage of application backups, system snapshots, and archival data. Helps meet compliance and disaster recovery requirements.

*Example*: Financial institutions store transaction records for 7+ years to meet regulatory requirements, often managing petabytes of historical data with strict immutability and access controls.

*Technical advantages*:
- 80-90% cost reduction compared to block storage for rarely accessed data through tiered storage classes
- Versioning capabilities provide point-in-time recovery options
- Object locking and WORM (Write Once Read Many) features ensure compliance requirements
- Cross-region replication provides geographic redundancy for disaster recovery

*Design considerations*:
- Implement lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between storage tiers
- Use object checksums and periodic integrity verification for long-term data protection
- Consider compression and deduplication for cost efficiency
- Develop clear data retention and purging policies

## Log & Metrics Storage
Aggregate application, infrastructure, or security logs in a central repository for analysis and monitoring, often as part of observability pipelines.

*Example*: Cloud-native applications generate billions of log entries daily (often 1+ TB) that need to be stored for troubleshooting and security analysis.

*Technical advantages*:
- Ability to scale to handle unpredictable logging spikes without managing additional servers
- Support for append operations in some blob stores optimizes log writing patterns
- Time-based object prefixes enable efficient querying of specific time ranges
- Integration with log analytics tools through standardized APIs

*Design considerations*:
- Implement partitioning strategies (time-based, service-based) to optimize query performance
- Use compression formats like Parquet or ORC for analytical workloads
- Consider batch uploading small log entries to reduce per-request costs
- Develop automated retention policies to control storage costs

## Data Lakes
Store raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data to support big data analytics, machine learning, and ETL workflows.

*Example*: Genomics research facilities store petabytes of sequencing data for ongoing analysis, requiring both durability and accessibility across multiple processing frameworks.

*Technical advantages*:
- Separation of storage from compute allows independent scaling and enables multiple processing engines to work on the same data
- Schema-on-read approach provides flexibility for evolving data structures
- Cost-effective storage enables retention of raw data for unanticipated future analysis
- Integration with data processing frameworks (Spark, Presto, Athena) with minimal ETL

*Design considerations*:
- Implement partitioning schemes that align with query patterns (e.g., date-based prefixes)
- Use columnar formats like Parquet or ORC to improve analytics performance
- Consider data cataloging and metadata management tools for discoverability
- Implement data governance policies for sensitive information

## Static Website Hosting
Host static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files. Enables fast, cost-effective delivery of websites and single-page applications.

*Example*: Modern JAMstack websites serve millions of requests directly from blob storage without maintaining traditional web servers, achieving 99.99% availability with minimal operational overhead.

*Technical advantages*:
- Serverless delivery model with built-in high availability and global distribution, eliminating web server management
- Automatic scaling to handle traffic spikes without configuration
- Significant cost savings compared to traditional web hosting
- Built-in SSL/TLS support with some providers

*Design considerations*:
- Implement CDN integration for edge caching and reduced latency
- Set appropriate cache-control headers for optimal performance
- Configure appropriate CORS settings for cross-origin resources
- Use redirects for SPA routing or URL normalization

## Mobile/IoT App Data
Collect and store telemetry, sensor data, and user-generated content from mobile apps and IoT devices in a scalable and durable format.

*Example*: Connected vehicle platforms collect terabytes of sensor data daily from millions of endpoints across varying connectivity conditions, using blob storage as the central repository for analytics and ML training.

*Technical advantages*:
- Reliable upload endpoints that can handle intermittent connectivity and varying data volumes without complex infrastructure
- Support for multipart uploads enables reliable large file transfers even with unstable connections
- Event-based processing triggers can automate data pipelines
- Efficient binary storage formats reduce bandwidth requirements

*Design considerations*:
- Implement client-side buffering and retry logic for unreliable connections
- Use batch uploading strategies to reduce API call volume
- Consider edge preprocessing to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements
- Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms for distributed devices

## AI/ML Model Storage and Serving
Store and distribute machine learning models, training datasets, and inference results in a standardized repository.

*Example*: Autonomous vehicle companies store and version multiple generations of ML models (often 1-10GB each) alongside the training data that produced them, enabling reproducibility and audit trails.

*Technical advantages*:
- Centralized model management with versioning capabilities
- Efficient distribution of models to edge devices or inference servers
- Standardized access patterns for model serving infrastructure
- Cost-effective storage for large training datasets

*Design considerations*:
- Implement metadata tagging for model performance metrics and lineage
- Use pre-signed URLs for secure, temporary access to models
- Consider compression techniques for efficient model distribution
- Implement access controls for proprietary models and sensitive training data

## Collaborative Workflows
Enable teams to share large files and collaborate on digital assets across geographic locations.

*Example*: Media production studios exchange terabytes of raw footage, renders, and production assets between global teams while maintaining version control and access permissions.

*Technical advantages*:
- Centralized storage eliminates the need for large file transfers between collaborators
- Versioning capabilities provide audit trails and recovery options
- Fine-grained access controls enable secure sharing with external partners
- Metadata tagging facilitates asset organization and discovery

*Design considerations*:
- Implement workflow tools that integrate with blob storage APIs
- Use pre-signed URLs with appropriate time limits for external sharing
- Consider regional storage placement to optimize access performance
- Implement appropriate encryption for sensitive content
