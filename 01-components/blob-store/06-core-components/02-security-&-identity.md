## Security Measures

- **Credential Protection**: Encryption of sensitive identity material

The Security & Identity components are designed to provide robust protection while maintaining performance and usability. The system employs a least-privilege approach by default, requiring explicit permission grants for all operations while providing the flexibility needed for complex organizational security requirements.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
