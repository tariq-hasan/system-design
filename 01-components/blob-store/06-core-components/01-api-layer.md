# 6.1 API Layer

The API Layer serves as the primary interface between client applications and the blob storage system, providing a consistent, secure, and scalable entry point for all operations. This layer is designed to handle high request volumes while maintaining performance, security, and flexibility.

## API Gateway

The API Gateway functions as the front door for all API requests, providing essential handling before requests reach the core services.

### Request Validation and Normalization
- **Schema validation**: Enforces correct request formats and required parameters
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents injection attacks and malformed requests
- **Parameter normalization**: Standardizes variations in inputs (case normalization, trailing slashes)
- **Content verification**: Validates content types, sizes, and formats
- **Header processing**: Handles standard and custom HTTP headers

*Implementation considerations*:
- Use declarative schema definitions rather than imperative validation code
- Implement validation as early as possible in the request flow
- Cache validation results for frequently used patterns
- Provide detailed error messages for API consumers while avoiding information leakage

### Protocol Support
- **REST API**: Primary interface with standard HTTP verbs (PUT, GET, POST, DELETE)
- **gRPC support**: For high-performance internal services and select client use cases
- **WebSocket connections**: For event notifications and real-time updates
- **Protocol translation**: Adapters for legacy protocols and specialized client needs
- **Content-type negotiation**: Support for JSON, XML, and binary formats

*Implementation considerations*:
- Maintain protocol-agnostic internal representations
- Implement API versioning at the protocol level
- Consider backward compatibility in all protocol evolutions
- Support protocol-specific optimizations (HTTP/2 for REST, binary for gRPC)

### Rate Limiting and Throttling
- **Multi-dimensional limits**: Based on account, IP, operation type, and resource impact
- **Adaptive throttling**: Dynamic adjustments based on system load and capacity
- **Fair usage allocation**: Weighted fair queuing across tenants
- **Burst handling**: Token bucket algorithms with configurable burst capacity
- **Graceful degradation**: Progressive throttling rather than hard rejections

*Implementation considerations*:
- Maintain distributed rate limit counters with eventual consistency
- Provide clear rate limit information in response headers
- Design for bypass capabilities during emergency scenarios
- Implement automatic retry-after guidance for clients

### DDoS Protection
- **Traffic fingerprinting**: Pattern recognition for attack detection
- **Anomaly detection**: Statistical monitoring for unusual request patterns
- **Connection throttling**: TCP connection limits and SYN flood protection
- **Geographic filtering**: Region-based access restrictions during attacks
- **Challenge-response mechanisms**: CAPTCHA or JavaScript challenges for suspicious traffic

*Implementation considerations*:
- Deploy multi-layer protection (network, transport, application)
- Integrate with CDN and edge protection services
- Implement progressive response measures based on threat severity
- Design fast-path allowlists for critical operations

### TLS Termination
- **Certificate management**: Automated rotation and renewal
- **Cipher suite control**: Modern, secure cipher configuration
- **Protocol version enforcement**: TLS 1.2+ with legacy fallback options
- **OCSP stapling**: Performance optimization for certificate validation
- **Perfect forward secrecy**: Using ephemeral key exchange

*Implementation considerations*:
- Centralize certificate management with automated renewal
- Implement SNI for multi-tenant environments
- Consider hardware acceleration for high-volume environments
- Monitor for certificate expiration and security vulnerabilities
- Implement mutually authenticated TLS for high-security use cases

## API Service

The API Service implements the core business logic for blob storage operations, translating client requests into internal system actions.

### RESTful Endpoints
- **Object Operations**:
  - `PUT /v1/{bucket}/{object}`: Upload or replace objects
  - `GET /v1/{bucket}/{object}`: Retrieve objects
  - `DELETE /v1/{bucket}/{object}`: Remove objects
  - `HEAD /v1/{bucket}/{object}`: Retrieve object metadata
  - `POST /v1/{bucket}/{object}?uploads`: Initiate multipart upload
  - `PUT /v1/{bucket}/{object}?partNumber={num}&uploadId={id}`: Upload part
  - `POST /v1/{bucket}/{object}?uploadId={id}`: Complete multipart upload

- **Bucket Operations**:
  - `PUT /v1/{bucket}`: Create bucket
  - `DELETE /v1/{bucket}`: Delete bucket
  - `GET /v1/{bucket}?list-type=2`: List objects
  - `GET /v1/{bucket}?versioning`: Get versioning status
  - `PUT /v1/{bucket}?versioning`: Configure versioning
  - `GET /v1/{bucket}?lifecycle`: Get lifecycle configuration
  - `PUT /v1/{bucket}?lifecycle`: Set lifecycle configuration

*Implementation considerations*:
- Maintain backward compatibility when evolving APIs
- Follow RESTful best practices for resource naming and HTTP status codes
- Implement consistent error response formats
- Support both path and subdomain-style bucket addressing
- Design idempotent operations where possible

### Request Orchestration
- **Operation decomposition**: Breaking complex requests into atomic operations
- **Parallel execution**: Concurrent processing of independent subtasks
- **Request tracking**: Correlation IDs and operation tracing
- **Timeout management**: Appropriate timeouts for different operation types
- **Retry handling**: Intelligent retry strategies with backoff

*Implementation considerations*:
- Implement workflow patterns for complex operations
- Use saga patterns for multi-step operations requiring compensation
- Design for partial success handling with clear status reporting
- Maintain idempotency across retry boundaries
- Implement circuit breakers for dependent services

### Pre-signed URL Generation
- **Time-limited access**: URLs valid from minutes to days
- **Operation restriction**: Limiting allowed HTTP methods (GET-only, PUT with size limits)
- **Condition parameters**: Restrict by IP, date range, or content type
- **Policy-based generation**: Authorization checks before URL creation
- **Revocation mechanisms**: Blacklisting compromised URLs

*Implementation considerations*:
- Use strong cryptographic signatures resistant to tampering
- Implement short default expiration times with explicit extension
- Include request conditions in the signed payload
- Consider object-specific access patterns when setting policies
- Support cross-account URL generation for collaboration

### Content Negotiation
- **Response format selection**: JSON, XML, YAML based on Accept headers
- **Compression options**: Support for gzip, brotli, and deflate
- **Language preferences**: Handling of Accept-Language for error messages
- **Version negotiation**: Content versioning via accept headers
- **Partial content**: Range requests for large objects

*Implementation considerations*:
- Implement efficient content type detection
- Use content negotiation for API versioning strategy
- Support quality values (q-values) in accept headers
- Design for graceful fallback when requested formats are unavailable
- Optimize common paths with content type assumptions

### Batch Operations
- **Multi-object operations**: Process sets of objects in a single request
- **Job-based processing**: Asynchronous execution of long-running operations
- **Progress tracking**: Status reporting for ongoing batch jobs
- **Partial success handling**: Detailed reporting on per-object status
- **Manifest-based operations**: Using object lists to define operation targets

## API Layer Design Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevents cascading failures when downstream services are degraded
- Automatically trips based on error rates or latency thresholds
- Provides fallback mechanisms during open circuit conditions
- Gradually tests recovery with partial traffic

### Fa√ßade Pattern
- Presents simplified interfaces to complex subsystems
- Handles backward compatibility across API versions
- Translates between external and internal data representations
- Centralizes cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, auth)

### Command Pattern
