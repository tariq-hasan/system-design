# 4. Non-Functional Requirements

A production-grade blob store must meet stringent operational requirements beyond basic functionality:

## Reliability & Durability

- **Data Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 9's)  
  The annual probability of losing an object should be no more than 0.0000000001%.
  
  *Design implications*: Multiple replicas across independent failure domains (minimum 3 regions), continuous data integrity verification with checksums, automated repair mechanisms with conflict resolution protocols, and regular recovery drills.

- **Service Availability**: 99.99% (four 9's)  
  System should be accessible 99.99% of the time, allowing for no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year.
  
  *Design implications*: N+2 redundancy for critical components, active-active deployment model across regions, automated failover mechanisms with <30 second recovery time, and comprehensive circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Latency Requirements**  
  - Object metadata operations: <50ms at p95, <100ms at p99
  - Small object retrieval (<1MB): <100ms at p95, <200ms at p99
  - Large object retrieval: <200ms first-byte time, then 100+ MB/s throughput
  - Write operations: <500ms acknowledgment time for durability commitment
  
  *Design implications*: Edge caching for hot objects, read-path optimization with CDN integration, locality-aware request routing, and tiered storage architecture based on access patterns.

- **Throughput Scaling**  
  System should maintain consistent performance as it scales to handle:
  - 10,000+ requests per second per tenant
  - Concurrent uploads/downloads from thousands of clients
  - Burst capacity up to 5x normal load for unpredictable traffic patterns
  - Bandwidth guarantees of 10+ Gbps per premium tenant
  
  *Design implications*: Horizontal scaling with consistent hashing, connection multiplexing, automatic load balancing, and priority-based request scheduling.

## Scalability Dimensions

- **Capacity Scaling**  
  Support seamless growth to:
  - Exabytes of total storage capacity
  - Billions of objects per tenant with efficient metadata indexing
  - Individual objects up to 5TB in size with multipart upload/download support
  - Linear cost scaling with increasing storage needs
  
  *Design implications*: Sharded metadata architecture, dynamic partitioning schemes, hierarchical namespace management, and elastic resource allocation with minimal rebalancing overhead.

- **User Scaling**  
  Handle growth in:
  - Number of concurrent users (millions)
  - Number of tenants (thousands) with strict isolation guarantees
  - Geographic distribution with region-specific compliance capabilities
  - Support for various client libraries and access patterns
  
  *Design implications*: Multi-tenancy with hard resource limits, global control plane with regional data planes, tenant-aware resource allocation, and adaptive throttling mechanisms.

## Security Requirements

- **Data Protection**  
  - Encryption at rest using industry-standard algorithms (AES-256)
  - Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3 with modern cipher suites
  - Optional customer-managed encryption keys with regular rotation
  - Secure key management with HSM integration
  
  *Design implications*: Centralized key management service, transparent encryption/decryption layer, performance optimization for crypto operations, and secure key storage with hardware protection.

- **Access Control**  
  - Fine-grained permissions at bucket, prefix, and object levels
  - Role-based access control with least-privilege principle enforcement
  - Time-bound and condition-based access capabilities
  - Integration with enterprise identity providers (OIDC, SAML)
  
  *Design implications*: High-performance policy evaluation engine, distributed authentication service, permission caching with rapid invalidation, and centralized policy management.

- **Audit & Compliance**  
  - Complete audit trails for all control and data plane operations
  - Compliance with regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, etc.)
  - Tamper-proof access logs with cryptographic verification
  - Configurable retention policies with legal hold capabilities
  
  *Design implications*: Immutable logging infrastructure, real-time compliance monitoring, configurable data residency controls, and third-party certification maintenance.

## Observability & Operational Excellence

- **Monitoring & Alerting**  
  - Real-time dashboards for system health and performance
  - Proactive anomaly detection with <5 minute alert time
  - End-to-end request tracing with context propagation
  - Customer-facing status page with transparent incident communication
  
  *Design implications*: Distributed tracing infrastructure, metrics collection pipeline, centralized logging solution, and SLO/SLA monitoring system.

- **Disaster Recovery**  
  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): zero data loss for committed data
  - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): <1 hour for regional failure
  - Regular disaster recovery exercises and simulations
  - Cross-region replication with automatic failover capabilities
  
  *Design implications*: Continuous data replication, automated recovery playbooks, cross-region consistency protocols, and geographic isolation of control mechanisms.

## Cost & Efficiency

- **Resource Optimization**  
  - Storage costs competitive with industry standards (<$0.02/GB for hot storage)
  - Tiered storage options with automated lifecycle management
  - Bandwidth optimization with compression and delta encoding
  - Minimized operational overhead through automation
  
  *Design implications*: Intelligent storage tiering, content-aware compression, deduplication for appropriate workloads, and automated resource scaling based on usage patterns.

- **Environmental Impact**  
  - Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) below 1.2 for all data centers
  - Renewable energy for 100% of storage operations
  - Hardware recycling program with certified disposal processes
  - Carbon-neutral operations with transparent reporting
  
  *Design implications*: Energy-efficient hardware selection, power monitoring at component level, optimized cooling systems, and sustainable data center partnerships.

## Maintainability & Evolution

- **Backwards Compatibility**
  - API versioning with minimum 18-month support for deprecated versions
  - Non-breaking changes for feature additions
  - Graceful degradation for removed functionality
  - Comprehensive migration tools for clients
  
  *Design implications*: API facade pattern, feature flags for gradual rollout, compatibility testing framework, and client library management.

- **Serviceability**
  - Zero-downtime updates and maintenance
  - Independent service components with clean interfaces
  - Automated testing with >95% code coverage
  - Comprehensive documentation and runbooks
  
  *Design implications*: Modular architecture, canary deployment pipeline, chaos engineering practices, and knowledge management system.
