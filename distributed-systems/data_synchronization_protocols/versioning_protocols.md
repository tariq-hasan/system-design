# [WIP] Versioning Protocols

- Techniques such as versioning and Merkle trees are used to efficiently synchronize data and detect changes in distributed systems.
- They are commonly used in distributed version control systems (DVCS) like Git and in distributed storage systems.

- Versioning protocols track different versions of data items and manage the reconciliation of divergent versions across replicas.
- Techniques such as vector clocks, Lamport timestamps, or hybrid logical clocks are commonly used to manage versioning in distributed systems.

- Maintain multiple versions of data to support concurrency control, conflict resolution, and rollback mechanisms.
- Examples include optimistic concurrency control and snapshot isolation.
