# Split-brain Scenarios

## Definition and Causes

- Split-brain scenarios occur in distributed systems when network partitions cause nodes to become divided into multiple disjoint groups, each believing it is the sole authority.
- These scenarios are typically triggered by network failures, hardware malfunctions, or configuration errors.

## Characteristics

- Each partition operates independently and may make decisions or perform actions without coordination with nodes in other partitions.
- This can lead to inconsistencies, conflicts, or divergent behavior within the system.

## Examples

- Database Cluster: Each partition may elect its own leader, resulting in multiple leaders concurrently managing the same data.
- Distributed Computing Environment: Nodes responsible for processing a shared task may continue processing independently, leading to duplicated or inconsistent outcomes.
- Replicated System: Partitions may continue serving read and write requests independently, resulting in conflicting updates or data inconsistencies.

## Consequences

- Split-brain scenarios compromise system correctness, consistency, and reliability.
- They can lead to data corruption, loss of data integrity, and degraded performance.

## Mitigation Strategies

- Distributed systems employ various mechanisms such as quorum-based algorithms, leader election protocols, and network partition detection to mitigate the risk of split-brain situations and ensure system integrity during network partitions.

# Data Synchronization Protocols

- Data synchronization protocols play a crucial role in ensuring data consistency, availability, fault tolerance, and reliability across nodes in distributed systems.
- These protocols facilitate the synchronization of data changes made at different locations within the distributed system, especially in environments where data may be subject to concurrent updates, network partitions, or node failures.

## Types of Protocols

- Conflict Resolution Protocols
  - Aim to resolve conflicts that arise when multiple nodes attempt to update the same data concurrently.
  - Examples include last-write-wins, timestamp-based conflict resolution, and conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).
- Consensus Protocols
  - Ensure that a group of nodes agrees on a single value or outcome, even in the presence of failures or partitions.
  - Examples include Paxos, Raft, and Zab.
- Data Consistency Protocols
  - Enforce consistency guarantees across distributed data stores to maintain data integrity.
  - Examples include linearizability, serializability, and eventual consistency.
- Quorum-based protocols
  - Rely on a threshold of votes or acknowledgments from a subset of nodes to make decisions or perform operations.
  - Ensure that a sufficient number of replicas agree on a particular action.
  - Examples include read and write quorums in distributed databases.
- Replication protocols
  - Replicate data across multiple nodes to enhance availability, fault tolerance, and load distribution.
  - Include techniques such as single-master replication, multi-master replication, and chain replication.
- Versioning protocols
  - Maintain multiple versions of data to support concurrency control, conflict resolution, and rollback mechanisms.
  - Examples include optimistic concurrency control and snapshot isolation.
