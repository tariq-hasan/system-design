- Tectonic is Facebook’s file system that was revealed in 2021.
- In many ways, it resembles Colossus.
- Tectonic’s primary focus is on achieving high data scalability with good resource utilization.
- Tectonic uses many independent services as building blocks, where each building block can scale independently.
