# 3. Functional Requirements

A well-designed blob store system must provide the following core capabilities and APIs that enable applications to effectively interact with stored objects:

## Object Operations

- **Upload objects (PUT)**  
  Store new objects or replace existing ones in the system.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Content type detection and validation
  - Automatic MD5/SHA checksumming for data integrity verification
  - Upload throttling for traffic management
  - Synchronous vs. asynchronous upload options
  - Server-side encryption upon ingestion
  - Upload success confirmation and ETag generation

- **Download objects (GET)**  
  Retrieve objects with predictable performance regardless of object size.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Conditional requests using If-Modified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match headers
  - Byte range requests (HTTP Range header) for partial content retrieval
  - Content-based transformations (like image resizing) on retrieval
  - Transfer encoding options (gzip, chunked)
  - Throttling controls to prevent abuse
  - Optimized response streaming for large objects

- **Delete objects (DELETE)**  
  Remove objects either permanently or with soft-delete capabilities for recovery.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Atomic deletion with consistent behavior on concurrent requests
  - Soft-delete/recycle bin functionality with retention period
  - Bulk delete operations with batching for efficiency 
  - Delete markers in versioned buckets
  - Required confirmation mechanisms for destructive operations
  - Cascading delete options for prefix-based deletion

- **List objects (LIST)**  
  Enumerate objects within a bucket or matching specific criteria.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Pagination with continuation tokens for handling large result sets
  - Filtering by prefix, suffix, and metadata values
  - Directory-style hierarchy simulation with delimiters
  - Customizable result ordering (by name, date, size)
  - Consistency guarantees for listings after recent modifications
  - Performance optimizations for common listing patterns

## Metadata Management

- **Custom metadata support**  
  Store and retrieve application-specific metadata alongside objects.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - User-defined key-value pairs with size limits (typically 2-4KB total)
  - Standard HTTP headers (Content-Type, Content-Disposition, Cache-Control)
  - System-generated metadata (size, ETag, timestamps)
  - Metadata-only operations to update attributes without reuploading objects
  - Searchable metadata capabilities for advanced query patterns
  - Metadata inheritance options for bulk operations

- **Tagging system**  
  Assign key-value tags to objects for categorization and lifecycle management.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Tag-based access control policies for granular permissions
  - Cost allocation and billing report integration
  - Tag limits (typically 10-50 tags per object)
  - Tag-based search and filtering capabilities
  - Bulk tagging operations across multiple objects
  - Tag replication policies across regions

## Organization

- **Bucket/container management**  
  Logically separate storage into isolated containers with their own policies.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Creation with globally unique naming
  - Region and storage class specification
  - Policy and permission assignment at container level
  - Quota and usage limits management
  - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration
  - Default encryption settings

- **Hierarchical organization**  
  Support folder-like structures through key prefixes.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Delimiter-based navigation (typically using '/')
  - Recursive and non-recursive listing options
  - Common prefix aggregation for directory-like views
  - Path-based permissions despite flat namespace implementation
  - Performance considerations for deeply nested structures
  - Rename/move operations optimization (typically copy+delete)

## Advanced Capabilities

- **Object versioning**  
  Maintain multiple versions of objects with the ability to restore previous states.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Version ID generation and management
  - Deletion markers for "removed" objects
  - Version enumeration with filtering options
  - Version-specific operations (retrieve, delete, restore)
  - MFA Delete protection for critical version operations
  - Storage impact considerations and version cleanup strategies

- **Lifecycle management**  
  Automate object transitions between storage tiers and eventual deletion.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Rule-based policies with flexible conditions (age, size, tags)
  - Transition actions between storage classes (hot → warm → cold → archive)
  - Expiration rules for automatic deletion
  - Versioning interaction with clear version pruning options
  - Incomplete multipart upload cleanup
  - Rule evaluation frequency and execution guarantees

- **Temporary access control**  
  Generate time-limited access credentials for controlled sharing.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Pre-signed URLs with configurable expiration (seconds to days)
  - Request condition restrictions (IP range, HTTP referrer)
  - Operation restrictions (GET-only, PUT with size limits)
  - Required vs. optional query parameters
  - URL signing algorithm security (HMAC-SHA256)
  - Revocation mechanisms for compromised URLs

- **Large object handling**  
  Support for objects significantly larger than typical web request limits.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Multipart upload API with part size requirements (typically 5MB-5GB)
  - Upload session management and state tracking
  - Concurrent upload capabilities with parallelization
  - Resume functionality after network interruptions
  - Part validation and complete/abort operations
  - Server-side part assembly with integrity verification

- **Event notifications**  
  Generate events when objects are created, deleted, or modified.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Filterable event types (create, delete, restore, etc.)
  - Pattern matching for object keys triggering notifications
  - Integration with messaging systems (SNS, SQS, Kafka, webhooks)
  - Delivery guarantees and failure handling
  - Event payload format standardization
  - Latency considerations and ordering guarantees

- **Cross-region replication**  
  Automatically replicate objects across geographic regions.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - One-way or bidirectional replication options
  - Selective replication based on prefixes or tags
  - Replication time monitoring and lag metrics
  - Conflict resolution strategies for concurrent modifications
  - Replication of metadata and tags
  - Failure handling and replication recovery

- **Batch operations**  
  Perform operations across large numbers of objects in a single request.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Job-based execution model with async completion
  - Operation types: copy, tag, restore, invoke function
  - Job priority and progress tracking
  - Completion reports and error handling
  - Rate limiting and resource management
  - Operation manifests for target specification

- **Object lock and retention**  
  Implement Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) policies for compliance.
  
  *Implementation aspects*:
  - Governance and compliance retention modes
  - Legal hold functionality independent of retention
  - Time-based retention periods (days to years)
  - Extend-only modification policies
  - Default retention settings at bucket level
  - Audit logging of retention policy changes
