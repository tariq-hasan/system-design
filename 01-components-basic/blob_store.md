# Distributed Storage Solutions

## Distributed Storage for Massive Systems

When designing massive systems, you'll often need to handle enormous amounts of unstructured data:
- Raw CSV files
- JSON files
- Log files
- Images, HTML pages, CSS, and other static content
- Backup data

This data requires a massively distributed storage solution with specific characteristics:

### Key Requirements for Distributed Storage

1. **Scalability**: Must handle virtually unlimited amounts of data
2. **High Availability**: Reliable access to data at all times
3. **Security**: Especially for personally identifiable or sensitive information
4. **Performance**: Fast retrieval within milliseconds when needed
5. **Durability**: Data should never be lost

## Common Use Cases

### Data Lakes
- Massive repositories of unstructured data
- Common in data analytics
- Raw data that needs to be processed and structured

### Static Content Storage
- Website assets (images, HTML, CSS)
- Content that changes infrequently
- High-read, low-write workloads

### Backup Systems
- Periodic copies of entire systems
- Disaster recovery scenarios
- Historical archives

## Storage Tiers and Access Patterns

Modern distributed storage systems typically offer multiple tiers:

### Hot Storage
- Distributed across many servers
- Fastest response time
- Most expensive option
- Used for frequently accessed data

### Cool Storage
- Slightly slower access times
- More cost-effective than hot storage
- Used for data accessed occasionally

### Cold Storage (e.g., Glacier)
- Archival data that's rarely accessed
- Significantly cheaper
- Long retrieval times (minutes to hours)
- Example: Amazon S3 Glacier for legacy data

## Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

SLAs define the guaranteed performance of storage systems:

### Durability SLAs
- Expressed as percentiles (e.g., 99.999999999% or "11 nines")
- Example: Amazon S3 offers 99.999999999% durability
- Meaning there's a 0.000000001% chance of losing data
- You can choose different durability levels based on requirements and budget

### Latency SLAs
- Define how quickly the system responds
- Example: "99.9% of requests will be returned within 100 milliseconds"
- Used to measure system performance
- Often monitored on dashboards with automated alerts when violated

### Availability SLAs
- Can be deceptive when expressed as percentages
- 99% availability = 3.65 days of downtime per year (often unacceptable)
- 99.999% availability = ~30 seconds of downtime per year
- Six nines (99.9999%) is typically a good target for critical systems
- Important to define what constitutes "acceptable" for your specific application

## Popular Distributed Storage Solutions

### Amazon S3
- Probably the most widely used solution
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model based on:
  - Amount of data stored
  - Access patterns
  - Durability requirements
- Multiple storage tiers (Standard, Infrequent Access, Glacier)
- Configurable redundancy options

### Google Cloud Storage
- Google's equivalent offering
- Similar features to Amazon S3

### Microsoft Azure Storage
- Microsoft's cloud storage solution
- Blob storage for unstructured data

### Hadoop HDFS
- Open-source solution for distributed storage
- Part of the Hadoop ecosystem
- Good option for private cloud implementations

### Consumer Options (Not typical for system design)
- Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive
- Made for individual users rather than programmatic access
- Not typically relevant in system design interviews

## Considerations for System Design Interviews

When discussing distributed storage in system design interviews:
- Focus on enterprise solutions (S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, HDFS)
- Match the storage solution to the company you're interviewing with
- Consider trade-offs between durability, cost, and access speed
- Define appropriate SLAs based on application requirements
- Be prepared to discuss how redundancy affects cost and durability
- Understand the implications of different access patterns on system design
